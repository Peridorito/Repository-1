 I am Batman, and this is my new website partialy explaining me and my utter awesomeness. I have Batman powers. My Batman powers include absolute awesomeness and coolness, I also have Batarangs, a super awesome Grappling Gun, an awesome motercycle that I call the Batpod, and my super sweet car the Batmobile. My favorite color is black, I only work in black, and sometimes very very dark grey. My greatest opponent is Superman, some honorable mentions include The Joker, Two Face, Clayface, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Killer Croc, Black Mask, Scarecrow, Bane, The Riddler, Harley Quinn, Ra's Al Ghul, Talia Al Ghul, Catwoman, Red Hood (that traitor), Hush, Deadshot, Man-Bat, and Killer Moth. I put up some of my favorate pictures of me down below.<br>
